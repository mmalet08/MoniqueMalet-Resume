        <p class="lead mb-4">Monique Malet ‘22 grew up in Diamond Bar, California and obtained her high school diploma from Diamond Bar High School. Currently, she is a 4th year undergraduate student at the University of California, Riverside. Monique is a Biology major. Upon her enrollment at the University of California, Riverside, Monique decided to pursue a career in healthcare. During her first year of college, Monique participated in a volunteer program at the Kaiser Permanente hospital in Riverside. Here, she focused most of her time on the family care unit. As of right now, she is currently a COPE Health Scholar and has been a part of the program for 2+ years, rotating through various hospital departments and working closely with nurses and physicians alike. While she has spent a few rotations on the Med Surg floors caring for mostly adult patients, she has spent the most time working on the postpartum units as well as the neonatal intensive care unit. As of right now, Monique has about 170 hours working on postpartum/neonatal intensive care units alone. She has a passion for working with mothers and their babies. She values the special moment that is bringing a newborn baby into this world and would love to be able to help mothers through this daunting process. 
e<br><br>

        She is also a research assistant to Dr. So Young Choe of the Psychology Department. Monique has always had an interest in psychology and understanding how she can apply that to her future in working with young children. She manages databases and assists on writing research articles to submit to editors from various scientific journals. Additionally, she prepares tables, graphs, fact sheets, and written reports summarizing research information. Dr. Choe’s research focuses strongly on psychologically controlling parenting and its effects on children and their development. Monique’s emphasis is psychologically controlling parenting among Asian, Latinx, & African American families, acculturation struggles, and mental health issues to assist in building a prevention/intervention program for target families. Essentially, she is focusing on developing better parenting strategies for immigrant parents that want to break their generational cycles of toxic parenting.<br><br>

       Aside from professional endeavors, a main hobby that Monique enjoys is playing water polo. Her love for the sport began during her freshman year of high school and she has continued to involve herself in it as a 4th year undergraduate student. Monique has coached various different age levels, ranging from five years old to 15 years old. She is an assistant coach at the Raptor Sports School in Chino Hills. Additionally, Monique is also a partner and barista at Starbucks. Upon her graduation from the University of California, Riverside, she plans on attending West Coast University in Anaheim to pursue her Bachelors of Science in Nursing. Monique hopes to become a registered nurse working on either labor and delivery floors or the neonatal intensive care unit. Further into her career as a nurse, Monique hopes to further her education as a nurse and pursue a degree as a Family Nurse Practitioner and open her own independent practice.
